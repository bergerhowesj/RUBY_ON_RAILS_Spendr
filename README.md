#       Spendr


Spendr is the website you didn't know you need. Spednr is the crumpled receipt in your wallet
eliminator. Spendr is the result of many years of frustration at tax time of trying to read faded, torn,
wet receipts. Spendr is a website that you can digitally add, categorise and make notes on receipts. The
end goal of Spendr? Total paper receipt domination!!

Spendr runs fully on Ruby on Rails with a SQLite database.

We would like to see Spendr evolve into a software that is easily integrated into POS systems or through
tap or QR software to allow for paperless transactions, eliminating the need for the user to manually input
the receipt. Further integration into tax lodgement software to allow for easy submission of deductables would
be the next goal after POS integration.

In the interest of confidence in Spendr, the upcoming versions will include
to ensure stability.

To begin with Spendr, sign up or log in with google, add a receipt, add items to the receipt, comment on the items as you require,
categorise and comment on your receipts as you wish.
